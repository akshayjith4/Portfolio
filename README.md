## About Me

Hi, I'm Akshayjith, a Full Stack Developer by day and a coding wizard by night. I turn coffee into code and dreams into apps. My love for debugging is only rivaled by my passion for deploying flawless code and optimizing algorithms. Cheers to making the web a better place, one line of code at a time!

## Skills

- **Web Development**: Master of crafting stunning, responsive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Skilled in turning complex requirements into elegant, user-friendly interfaces.
- **Python**: Adept at using Python for everything from web development to automation. Whether it’s building dynamic web apps with Flask or diving into data analysis, Python is my go-to tool.
- **Bug Bounty**: Known for my uncanny ability to communicate with code and debug issues with a sense of humor. My debugging skills are so sharp that even the bugs ask for a timeout!
